# How to play:

**Players take turns rolling the dice and accumulate points for that turn. If player rolls a 1, their turn will be over and they will not be able to add those accumulated points to their score. If they choose to hold at anytime before risking rolling a 1, they will be able to add the accumulated points to their overall score. The first player who reaches 100 points will win the game!**
